# Speaker's Package
The following is a general starter package for giving presentations at GDG Cloud Vancouver.
They are _suggestions only_ with the exception of the **Talk Requirements**. Feel free to adapt them to your particular topic or presentation style.

## Talk Requirements
The following are rules every talk must respect:

- It must be related to the tech industry (even if loosely related).
- It must not sell or pitch.
- It must not be used as marketing.
- It can not be a recruiting tool.
- It must respect our [code of conduct](https://github.com/GDGV/resources/code-of-conduct/blob/master/community_coc.md).

## The Community Stage Format
At GDG Cloud Vancouver, we generally have 
- Lightinig Talks (15-30 mins)
- Standard Talks (30-60 mins)
- Codelabs (1 - 1.5 hours)
- Workshops (1.5 - 3 hours)

## General Overview
1. Introduce yourself
  - Who are you?
  - What do you do?
  - Why are you interested in this topic?
  - Humanize yourself: what is something else about you?
    - Are you a coffee snob, play in a metal band, or have a particularly lazy cat?
  - Feel free to self-promote (as long as you don't do a recruiting pitch for a company)

2. Situate the topic
  - Give a very high-level overview or analogy to sum up what you're going to talk about
  - Was it a fun project or experience?
  - Is it a product that is gaining popularity? Why?
  - Are there competing technologies or ideas? Why choose this one?

3. Introduce the main ideas
  - This is the main body of the presentation
  - Most people budget for about 4-6 minutes on the main topic
    - You need to leave time to wrap up later, and you spent some time in the introduction
  - Keep the slides simple, preferably images, analogies and examples
    - Speak on the details
      - Feel free to bring cue cards or use the speaker's notes feature in Keynote or PowerPoint

4. Time check! If you're at nearing your allotted time, it's probably time to start wrapping up!
  - If you need an extra few minutes, don't sweat it. Just try to keep as close to 10 minutes as possible.

5. Summarize the talk
  - Did you learn something important?
  - Where can people go to find out more?
  - Can people come find you afterwards if they're interested?

6. If you're open to it, provide a way for people to reach out about further info
  - Twitter handle
  - GitHub link
  - Email address

## Advice & Gotchas
- The audience at GDG Cloud Vancouver is _very_ diverse, with a wide set of backgrounds and levels of experience
  - Assume that people have not had experience with this topic before
- We have found that having slides is helpful for framing the topic, and to provide visual example
- Use animated gifs whenever possible. Seriously. People love animated gifs.
- Live coding can work well, as long as the examples are kept short and simple.
  - Don't forget to bump up the font size _way up_ for the projector!
- Do a dry run at home to get a sense of time and flow
- This isn't your one chance that you _must get right_. You can speak many times!
- Quite a few of our members have spoken. We know that it can be intimidating. Don't worry! We're rooting for you!
